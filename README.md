# CourseMate

## Why did you make this app?
Students who are going to be heading off to college in the fall are going to have a harder time to connect with classmates when they can't physically see them or interact with them after class and walking around campus. Likewise, if students are working from home, then that makes it far more difficult for them to remember everyone in their class and keep in touch with acquiantances that they may have met in the past but haven't talked to in a while. That's why this app exists: to connect students with their current classmates and get close to simulating what a spontaneous connection could be like on campus.

## What is this app all about?
CourseMate lets you input your (CMU-only, for now) courses into the application, either through verification with SIO or by manually inputting in your courses and recitations. From that information, we can display the total volume of students who are in that class that are using our app, as well as display data from the registration page for each class. Also, you can click on students to connect with them, either via their available social media or through other methods of communication that they supply. On login, your home page will have your current classes as well as your current connections.

## What languages is CourseMate coded in?
CourseMate is coded almost entirely in React Native, using Expo as our testing framework. 

## Who made it?
This app was made by Siddharth Paratkar, Ihita Mandal, David Lyons and Nathan Walker.
